- **Clear All** — wipe the entire canvas
- **Save** — export drawing layer as transparent PNG

### Settings Auto-save
Tool selection, color, stroke width, fill, highlight mode, and font are automatically saved on exit and restored on next launch.  
Settings are stored at: `~/.local/share/screendrawing/settings.json`

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Hold Ctrl** — temporary eraser (releases back to previous tool)
- **Hold Shift** — temporary straight line (releases back to previous tool)

### Other
- Auto language detection (Korean / English based on system locale)
- Wayland compatible (GNOME tested)
- Lightweight — PyQt5 only, no extra dependencies

---

## 🖥️ Environment

Tested on:

- Ubuntu 24.04
- GNOME Wayland Session
- Python 3.x + PyQt5

---

## 📦 Requirements

```bash
pip install PyQt5
```

---

## 📥 Installation (No sudo, Recommended)

### 1. Download

Download `screendrawing.py` from this repository.

### 2. Make executable

```bash
chmod +x screendrawing.py
```

### 3. Install to user PATH

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
mv screendrawing.py ~/.local/bin/screendrawing
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/screendrawing
```

Make sure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH. Add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` if needed:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Now you can run it from anywhere:

```bash
screendrawing
```

## ⚠️ Wayland (GNOME) Notes

ScreenDrawing is primarily developed and tested on GNOME Wayland.

If the toolbar does not appear, try running with the platform flag:

```bash
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland screendrawing
```

---

## 💾 Save Behavior

The **Save** button exports the drawing layer only as a transparent PNG (`~/drawing_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.png`).

This is intentional and useful for:

- Overlay editing in image editors
- Presentation slides
- Video annotation
- Tutorial / lecture materials
- Image compositing

To capture the full screen including the background and your drawings, use an external screenshot tool **while ScreenDrawing is running**:

- **GNOME Screenshot** (`gnome-screenshot`)
- **Spectacle** (KDE)
- **Flameshot**

---

## 🚀 Desktop Launcher

To add ScreenDrawing to the application menu, create a `.desktop` file:

```bash
nano ~/.local/share/applications/screendrawing.desktop
```

Paste the following:

```ini
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Exec=screendrawing
Icon=applications-graphics
Type=Application
Terminal=false
Name=ScreenDrawing
GenericName=Screen Drawing Tool
Comment=Lightweight screen drawing overlay
StartupNotify=false
Categories=Utility;
```

Then refresh the application database:

```bash
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications
```

ScreenDrawing will now appear in your application menu.

## 📌 Notes

- Runs as a fullscreen transparent overlay
- Eraser size is shared with the stroke width setting
- Highlight mode works on pen (freehand), line, rectangle, and ellipse
- Holding `Ctrl` or `Shift` temporarily switches tools and restores them on release
- All drawing is non-destructive to the desktop — only the overlay canvas is affected
- Settings (tool, color, width, font, fill, highlight) are auto-saved on exit to `~/.local/share/screendrawing/settings.json`
